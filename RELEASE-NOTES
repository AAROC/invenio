Upgrade notes:
--------------

To upgrade from CDSware v0.3.3, please follow about these steps:

   - Stop bibsched daemon and all submission procedures and write
     operations.  For example, you may want to disable the site
     completely.  Then backup your current database and CDSware files
     in the installation directory.

   - Untar new sources and rerun configure --prefix=... with old
     parameters.

   - Merge your old config.wml with the new one.  There are new
     options in the new config.wml, so it is not sufficient just to
     copy over your old config file.  However, the new config file
     only adds new options, so merging of your old file should be very
     straightforward.

   - Run make. 

   - Update your table structure with new definitions:

       $ make update-v0.3.3-tables

     If you are upgrading from previous releases, you have to run
     previous update-v0.3.0-tables and friends respectively first.
     (See Makefile.am for what these commands do.)

   - Update your table content with new definitions:

       . To activate ranking by word similarity, you have to run SQL
         statements related to rnkMETHOD tables, e.g. like this:
       
             $ echo "TRUNCATE rnkMETHOD; TRUNCATE rnkMETHODDATA;" | \
               ./modules/miscutil/bin/dbexec
             $ echo "TRUNCATE rnkMETHODNAME; TRUNCATE collection_rnkMETHOD;" | \
               ./modules/miscutil/bin/dbexec
             $ grep rnkMETHOD modules/miscutil/sql/tabfill.sql | \
               ./modules/miscutil/bin/dbexec

         or you can configure ranking methods via BibRank Admin
         interface.

       . The EXTRACT_EMAIL BibFormat UDF function has been fixed
         (thanks to Guido Pelzer) and you are advised to delete the
         old definition and enter the new one, e.g. like this:

             $ echo "DELETE FROM flxUDFS WHERE fname='EXTRACT_EMAIL';" | \
               ./modules/miscutil/bin/dbexec
             $ grep "EXTRACT_EMAIL.*if" modules/miscutil/sql/tabfill.sql | \
               ./modules/miscutil/bin/dbexec

     By doing this your table definitions should be fully up to date.

   - Run make install and restart your Apache server.  Restart
     bibsched in the auto mode.  If you activated some ranking
     methods, you have to tell bibsched to execute bibrank daemon
     periodically, for example:

        $ bibrank -s1h

     (See also ``HOWTO Run..'' documentation in the Admin Area.)

   - You are done. Check that everything is running fine.


Known problems:
---------------

 *) Several modules of the this release (e.g. the mail submission
    system) are experimental and not yet activated.  You may have a
    peek at what is planned, but please do not rely on them.

 *) The admin-level functionality for several modules is not fully
    developed yet.

 *) Fulltext file storage management is not yet linked with the
    metadata management.
 
 *) ElmSubmit module not yet activated.


What's next:
------------

 *) Fixing the problems mentioned above.

 *) Developing BibIndex for better phrase indexing and browsing.

 *) Developing clearer relations and dependencies between metadata
    records and fulltext files.

 *) Automatic reference extraction program. 

 *) Citation search and ranking.

 *) Download statistics and ranking.
