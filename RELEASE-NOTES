Notes: 
   This DEVELOPMENT release contains an important security fix.  All
   CDSware DEVELOPMENT users (v0.1.x and v0.3.x) are asked to upgrade
   to v0.3.1 as soon as possible.  Users of v0.0.9 are not affected.

Known problems:
   Ranking engine is fully functional from the admin-level point of
   view, but the end-user ranking functionality still has to be
   plugged into the search interface.  Several important admin-level
   functionalities of v0.0.9 are still missing in the v0.3.x tree.

What's next: 
   Fixing known problems described above.  Developing BibIndex for
   better phrase indexing and browsing.
