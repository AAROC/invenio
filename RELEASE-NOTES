Notes: 
   This is a development branch release.  Users of 0.0.9 are advised
   to wait for the next stable release.  Users of 0.1.0 may upgrade to
   0.1.1 if the above features are important to them.

Known problems: 
   WebSubmit is not working properly yet.  Several admin-level
   functionality of 0.0.9 is missing in 0.1.0 yet.  The task scheduler
   is functional but not yet fully tested.  These issues will be
   subsequently dealt with in the next releases of the 0.1.x
   development branch.

What's next: 
   Fixing known problems described above.  Stabilizing the 0.1.x tree.
   Continuing with the internationalization of the interface.
   Introducing BibIndex for better phrase indexing and browsing.
