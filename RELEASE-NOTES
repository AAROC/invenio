Installation notes:
-------------------

Please follow the INSTALL file bundled in the distribution tarball.

Upgrade notes:
--------------

If you are upgrading from CDS Invenio v0.90.0, then please follow the
following steps:

   - Launch the bibsched monitor and wait until all active bibsched
     tasks are finished.  Then put bibsched daemon into manual mode.

   - Stop all submission procedures and other write operations: for
     example, you may want to switch your site to read-only mode (set
     CFG_ACCESS_CONTROL_LEVEL_SITE to 1 in access_control_config.py
     and restart Apache) or you may want to stop Apache completely.

   - Optionally, you may want to backup your current MySQL database
     and your CDS Invenio installation directory (@prefix).  Note that
     this step is not really necessary for 0.90.0 -> 0.90.1 upgrade,
     since the changes are of minor nature only.

   - Untar new sources and rerun configure with old arguments.  Your
     old configure line is available at
     @prefix@/etc/build/config.nice.

   - Merge your old config.wml with the new one.  Your old config.wml
     file is available at @prefix@/lib/wml/invenio/config.wml.  The
     only novelty in the new config.wml file is the introduction of
     the Bulgarian translation in the CDSNAMEINTL and CDSLANGS
     options, so that merging should be straightforward.  Note that
     you may directly reuse your old config.wml file in case you do
     not plan to provide your user interface in Bulgarian.

   - Run make.

   - If you have customized your @prefix/etc/ files since the
     last installation (for example to edit the stopwords list or
     configure language stemmers), then back them up now.

   - Run make install.

   - If you have backed up your old @prefix@/etc/ directory as
     mentioned before, then restore your old etc files now.

   - Optionally, update your tables with the new Bulgarian and updated
     French and Russian dynamic elements:

        $ grep "'bg'" modules/miscutil/sql/tabfill.sql | \
               ./modules/miscutil/bin/dbexec  
        $ echo "UPDATE fieldname SET value='identificateur de notice' \
                 WHERE value='notice ID' AND id_field=14 AND ln='fr';" | \
               ./modules/miscutil/bin/dbexec  
        $ echo "UPDATE fieldname SET value='предмет' \
                WHERE value='' AND id_field=7 AND ln='ru';" | \
               ./modules/miscutil/bin/dbexec  
        $ echo "UPDATE fieldname SET value='разделение' \
                WHERE value='' AND id_field=11 AND ln='ru';" | \
               ./modules/miscutil/bin/dbexec  
        $ echo "UPDATE fieldname SET value='эксперимент' \
                WHERE value='' AND id_field=13 AND ln='ru';" | \
               ./modules/miscutil/bin/dbexec  
        $ echo "UPDATE fieldname SET value='номер записи' \
                WHERE value='' AND id_field=14 AND ln='ru';" | \
               ./modules/miscutil/bin/dbexec  

   - Optionally, run webcoll to regenerate Bulgarian, French, and
     Russian search interface pages.

   - Re-enable write access if you have disabled it before and restart
     your Apache server.

   - Put the bibsched daemon back into the automatic mode.  You are
     done.

If you want to upgrade from CDSware v0.7.1 or earlier versions, please
do not use this release for production environment yet.  The codebase
has undergone very important changes during the last year.  You can
use this release to check out the new CDS Invenio features and test it
in your environment.  Full-scale upgrade instructions and tools will
be provided with the forthcoming update release in August 2006.

Known problems:
---------------

 *) Several modules of the this release (e.g. the new BibFormat in
    Python, the mail submission system, citation ranking) are still
    experimental and not yet activated.  You may have a peek at what
    is planned, but please do not rely on them.

 *) The admin-level functionality for several modules is not fully
    developed yet.

What's next:
------------

 *) Fixing the problems mentioned above.

 *) Providing an easy-to-use upgrade path for CDSware v0.7.1 users.

 *) The next release should happen in August 2006.
