Notes: 
   This development branch release is intended primarily to fix
   BibReformat's task-launching password-reading problem that slipped
   into v0.1.1.  Users of v0.1.1 are advised either to patch their
   running CDSware installation by this one-liner:

      $ perl -pi~ -e 's,getpass\(,getpass.getpass(,g' /path/to/your/cdsware/bin/bibreformat

   or to upgrade to v0.1.2 which brings, as a bonus, updated Spanish
   translation.

Known problems: 
   WebSubmit is not working yet.  Several admin-level functionality of
   v0.0.9 is missing in v0.1.x.  The task scheduler is functional but
   not fully tested.  These issues will be subsequently dealt with in
   the next releases of the v0.1.x development branch.

What's next: 
   Fixing known problems described above.  Stabilizing the v0.1.x
   tree.  Continuing with the internationalization of the interface.
   Introducing BibIndex for better phrase indexing and browsing.
