Installation notes:
-------------------

Please follow the INSTALL file bundled in the distribution tarball.

Upgrade notes:
--------------

If you are upgrading from CDSware v0.7.0, then please follow the
following steps:

   - Launch the bibsched monitor and wait until all active bibsched
     tasks are finished.  Then put bibsched daemon into sleeping
     (manual) mode.

   - Stop all submission procedures and other write operations: for
     example, you may want to switch your site to read-only mode (set
     CFG_ACCESS_CONTROL_LEVEL_SITE to 1 in access_control_config.py
     and restart Apache) or you may want to stop Apache completely.

   - Optionally you may want to backup your current MySQL database and
     your CDSware installation directory.  (This step is not really
     mandatory for the 0.7.0 -> 0.7.1 transition, since the changes
     are of minor nature only.)

   - Untar new sources and rerun configure with old arguments (see
     /path/to/cdsware/lib/wml/cdsware/etc/build/config.nice).

   - Merge your old config.wml with the new one. (Your old config.wml
     can be found in /path/to/cdsware/lib/wml/cdsware/config.wml.)
     The only novelty in the new config.wml file is the introduction
     of the Catalan translation in the CDSNAMEINTL and CDSLANGS
     options, so that merging should be straightforward.  Note that
     you may directly reuse your old config.wml file in case you do
     not plan to provide your user interface in Catalan.

   - Run make.

   - If you have customized your /path/to/cdsware/etc/ files since the
     last installation (for example to edit the stopwords list or
     configure language stemmers), then back them up now.

   - Run make install.

   - If you have backed up your old /path/to/cdsware/etc/ directory as
     mentioned before, then restore your old etc files now.

   - Optionally update your tables with the new Catalan and Spanish
     field names:

        $ grep "'ca'" modules/miscutil/sql/tabfill.sql | \
               ./modules/miscutil/bin/dbexec  
        $ echo "UPDATE fieldname SET value='materia' \
                 WHERE value='' AND id_field=7 AND ln='es';" | \
               ./modules/miscutil/bin/dbexec  
        $ echo "UPDATE fieldname SET value='división' \
                WHERE value='' AND id_field=11 AND ln='es';" | \
               ./modules/miscutil/bin/dbexec  
        $ echo "UPDATE fieldname SET value='experimento' \
                WHERE value='' AND id_field=13 AND ln='es';" | \
               ./modules/miscutil/bin/dbexec  
        $ echo "UPDATE fieldname SET value='registro núm.' \
                WHERE value='' AND id_field=14 AND ln='es';" | \
               ./modules/miscutil/bin/dbexec  

   - Optionally run webcoll to regenerate Catalan and Spanish search
     interface pages.

   - Re-enable write access if you have disabled it before and restart
     your Apache server.

   - Put the bibsched daemon back into the automatic mode.  You are
     done.

Known problems:
---------------

 *) Several modules of the this release (e.g. the mail submission
    system, citation and download ranking) are experimental and not
    yet activated.  You may have a peek at what is planned, but please
    do not rely on them.

 *) The admin-level functionality for several modules is not fully
    developed yet.

 *) Fulltext file storage management is not yet linked with the
    metadata management.
 
What's next:
------------

 *) Fixing the problems mentioned above.

 *) Developing clearer relations and dependencies between metadata
    records and fulltext files.

 *) Introducing page templating to ease the customization of CDSware
    interface.

 *) Introducing a new tool for matching external XML MARC records
    against the database content.
