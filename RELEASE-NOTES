If you are upgrading from CDS Invenio v0.99.0, then please stop your
bibsched queue and your Apache server and install the v0.99.1 update
in the following way:

  $ cd cds-invenio-0.99.1
  $ cp -a /opt/cds-invenio/etc /opt/cds-invenio/etc.OLD
  $ sh /opt/cds-invenio/etc/build/config.nice
  $ make install

  $ make check-custom-templates
  $ diff -r /opt/cds-invenio/etc /opt/cds-invenio/etc.OLD

and then study the differences in the 'etc' folder and copy or merge
your past customizations (namely, files like HB.bfo).  After that
restart your Apache server and your bibsched queue and you are done.

    developed or documented yet.
