Notes:
   This is a development branch release.  It is not meant to replace
   CDSware 0.0.9.  Users of 0.0.9 are advised to wait for the next
   stable release.  Users of 0.0.9+ are advised to upgrade to 0.1.0.

   As of this release we are adopting the classical stable/development
   branch version numbering scheme spread in the GNU/Linux world and
   elsewhere, with even minor versions denoting stable branch releases
   and odd minor versions denoting development releases.  For more
   details, see <http://cdsware.cern.ch:8000/hacking/releases.html>.

Known problems:
   WebSubmit is not working properly yet.  Several admin-level
   functionality of 0.0.9 is missing in 0.1.0 yet.  The task scheduler
   and RBAC authentication engines are functional but not yet called
   by all the clients.  These issues will be subsequently dealt with
   in the next releases of the 0.1.x development branch.

What's next:
   Fixing known problems described above.  Stabilizing the 0.1.x tree.
   Continuing with the internationalization of the interface.
   Introducing BibIndex for better phrase indexing and browsing.
