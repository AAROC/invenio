Notes:
------

 *) This DEVELOPMENT release is recommended to all users of prior
    v0.1.x and v0.3.x versions.  Users of the STABLE v0.0.9 release
    are invited to test it and let us know their comments.

 *) Due to popular demand, search engine behaviour has changed on
    stage 4-2-1 in the following way: when no hits are found in the
    collection selected by the user, but there are some hits in other
    public collections, then do not show these hits anymore to the end
    user, but rather propose link to them only.  (Often users were
    confused as to why their collection choice wasn't respected.)

 *) This release contains new international names for fields such as
    author, title.  If you haven't configured previously your fields
    and their international field names manually, then you may want to
    insert them now via commands like:

        $ echo "SELECT count(*) FROM fieldname;" | dbexec ## check if output is 0
        $ grep "INTO fieldname V" ./modules/miscutil/sql/tabfill.sql | dbexec

    See the content of the concerned file for details.  You may also
    configure them manually via BibIndex Web Admin interface.

Known problems:
---------------

 *) The admin-level functionality for several modules is not fully
    developed yet.

 *) Fulltext file storage management is not yet linked with the
    metadata management.

What's next:
------------

 *) Fixing the problems mentioned above.

 *) Introducing `find similar' and `sort by relevance' functionalities
    into the search engine.

 *) Developing BibIndex for better phrase indexing and browsing.

 *) Developing clearer relations and dependencies between metadata
    records and fulltext files.
