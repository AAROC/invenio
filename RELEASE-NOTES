Hello

     in all CDSware modules as the new default internal XML file format

   * search interface now honors multiple output formats per collection
     (BibFormat, WebSearch)
   * search interface now honors search fields, search options, and
     sort options from the database config tables (WebSearch,
     WebSearch Admin)
   * search interface now honors words indexes from the database config
     tables (BibWords, WebSearch)
   * easy reformatting of already uploaded bibliographic records via
     web admin. tool (BibFormat Admin/Reformat Records)
   * new submission form field type ("response") allowing
     greater flexibility (WebSubmit) [thanks to Frank Sudholt]
   * demo site "Atlantis Institute of Science" updated to demonstrate:
     Pictures collection of photographs; specific per-collection
     formats; references inside Articles and Preprints; "cited by"

Notes:
   As of release v0.0.9 the CDSware uses recently standardized MARC
   XML schema provided by the Library of Congress. The default
   configurations of nearly all CDSware modules have been changed
   accordingly. We recommend you to install from scratch rather than
   over an existing previous v0.01preX installations. However, in case
   you want to keep your existing configuration and data, please feel
   free to contact us for assistance.

Known problems:
   The admin interface is missing some functionality (e.g. there is no
   BibWords Admin yet).  The interaction between WebSubmit and
   WebSearch is missing some functionality (e.g. search pages are not
   updated automatically when new documents are submitted).  We plan
   to concentrate on these problems now.

What's next:
   The v0.0.9 release should be the last one in the v0.0.x series. We
   plan to complete various missing admin interface functionality and
   to release v0.1 during August 2002.
