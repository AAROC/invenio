Installation notes:
-------------------

Please follow the INSTALL file bundled in the distribution tarball.


Upgrade notes:
--------------

If you are upgrading from CDSware v0.5.0, then please follow these
steps:

   - New pre-requisite (optional): if you want to experiment with the
     automatic reference extraction from PDF fulltext files, then you
     have to check whether your pdftotext program is of version 3 or
     later.  (See the INSTALL file, item i.)  Note that you are fully
     free to skip this step now.

   - New pre-requisite (optional): if you want to experiment with the
     download and citation ranking alpha codebase, then we recommend
     you to firstly install Gnuplot, the command-line driven
     interactive plotting program.  (See the INSTALL file, item l.)
     Note that you are fully free to skip this step now.

   - New pre-requisite (optional): if you want to experiment with the
     new WebStat program for gathering usage statistics out of Apache
     log files, then you should firstly install a Common Lisp
     implementation.  (See the INSTALL file, item m.)  Note that you
     are fully free to skip this step now.

   - After optionally updating your prerequisites, launch the bibsched
     monitor and wait until all active bibsched tasks are finished.
     Then put bibsched daemon into manual mode.  Stop all submission
     procedures and other write operations: for example, you may want
     to switch your site read-only (set CFG_ACCESS_CONTROL_LEVEL_SITE
     to 1 in access_control_config.py and restart Apache) or you may
     want to stop Apache completely.

   - Optionally you may want to backup your current MySQL database and
     your CDSware installation directory.  (This step is not really
     mandatory for the 0.5.0 -> 0.7.0 transition, since the changes
     are of minor nature only.)

   - Untar new sources and rerun configure with old arguments.  

   - Merge your old config.wml with the new one.  (The old config.wml
     can be found in /path/to/cdsware/lib/wml/cdsware/config.wml.)
     There are some new options in the new config.wml, so it is not
     sufficient just to copy over your old config file.  However, the
     new config file only changes two-three language-related things in
     the beginning of the file, so merging of your old config.wml
     should be very straightforward.

   - Run make.

   - If you have edited your /path/to/cdsware/etc/ files during or
     since the last installation (for example to edit the stopwords
     list or configure language stemmers), then back it up now.

   - Run make install.

   - If you have backed up your old /path/to/cdsware/etc/ directory as
     mentioned above, then copy the backup over the freshly installed
     etc directory now.  The old etc directory should be usable `as
     is', unless you have configured bibrank to use the Swedish
     stemmer, in which case you should change the language code from
     `se' to `sv' in /path/to/cdsware/etc/bibrank/wrd.cfg.

   - Update your table structure with new definitions:

        $ make update-v0.5.0-tables

     If you are upgrading from previous releases, you have to run
     previous update-xxx-tables commands first, respectively.  (See
     Makefile.am for what these commands do, and check out old
     RELEASE-NOTES for previous releases.)

   - Run webcoll.  The update is done now.

   - The final stages are: re-enable write-access if you have disabled
     it in the previous steps; restart your Apache server; put
     bibsched back into the auto mode.  You are done.


Known problems:
---------------

 *) Several modules of the this release (e.g. the mail submission
    system, citation and download ranking) are experimental and not
    yet activated.  You may have a peek at what is planned, but please
    do not rely on them.

 *) The admin-level functionality for several modules is not fully
    developed yet.

 *) Fulltext file storage management is not yet linked with the
    metadata management.
 

What's next:
------------

 *) Fixing the problems mentioned above.

 *) Developing clearer relations and dependencies between metadata
    records and fulltext files.

 *) Introducing page templating to ease the customization of CDSware
    interface.

 *) Introducing a new tool for matching external XML MARC records
    against the database content.
