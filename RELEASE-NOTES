Notes: 
------

 *) This DEVELOPMENT release is recommended to all users of prior
    v0.1.x and v0.3.x versions.  Users of the STABLE v0.0.9 release
    are invited to test it and let us know their comments.

 *) This release contains some minor SQL table updates.  If you are
    upgrading from v0.3.0 or v0.3.1, then after you build CDSware:

      $ ./configure --prefix=[...]
      $ vi config/config.wml
      $ make

    you have to run:

      $ make update-v0.3.1-tables

    and then continue as usual:

      $ make install
      $ sudo apachectl restart

 *) This release contains important fix for BibUpload append mode.
    Note that BibUpload append mode is normally not used by WebSubmit
    or any other tools, so most probably you do not have to pay
    attention to this problem.  You might be affected only if you have
    expressly used BibUpload append mode (``bibupload -a'') in the
    command line.  If this is indeed the case, then you have to
    recreate XML MARC and other formats of your metadata.  The steps
    to take to recreate formats for your records (say 123) would go
    like this:

      $ echo "TRUNCATE TABLE bibfmt;" | ./modules/miscutil/bin/dbexec
      $ wget -O z.xml 'http://your.site/search.py?id=1&idb=123&of=xm&rg=500'
      $ bibupload -r z.xml
      $ bibreformat -oHB,HD,HP,HC
      $ bibsched

    Please contact our mailing list if you want to know more.  

 *) This release contains an initial version of the WebSearch Admin
    Interface.  It is fully functional but has not been fully tested
    under CERN production conditions yet.

 *) As of this release, all CDSware releases will be cryptographically
    signed.  See the INSTALL file for more details.

Known problems:
---------------

 *) Ranking engine is fully functional from the admin-level point of
    view, but the end-user ranking functionality still has to be
    plugged into the search interface.

 *) The admin-level functionality for several modules is not fully
    developed yet.

 *) Fulltext file storage management is not yet linked with the
    metadata management.

What's next: 
------------

 *) Fixing the problems mentioned above.  

 *) Introducing ranking methods and international collection names
    into the search engine.  

 *) Developing BibIndex for better phrase indexing and browsing.

 *) Developing clearer relations and dependencies between metadata
    records and fulltext files.
