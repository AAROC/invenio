Notes: 
   The minor version number of the development branch was bumped to
   indicate important SQL table structure changes.  An upgrade from
   CDSware v0.1.x is relatively easy though.  Please contact us if you
   want some hints in this direction.  (We do not provide an upgrade
   script automatically in the tarball because of the development
   branch nature of the release.)

   CDSware v0.3.0 now includes the first Pythonic DEVELOPMENT version
   of the WebSubmit module.  We encourage you to test it.  Users of
   v0.0.9 are however advised to stay with their system until a STABLE
   release is announced.

Known problems:
   Several important admin-level functionality of v0.0.9 is still
   missing in v0.3.0.  These issues will be subsequently dealt with in
   the next releases of the v0.3.x development branch.

What's next: 
   Fixing known problems described above.  Developing BibIndex for
   better phrase indexing and browsing.  Introducing BibRank to
   provide basic ranking features.
