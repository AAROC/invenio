==================================================

      $ cd /usr/local/src/cdsware-0.9
      $ gmake uninstall     ## NOTE: This has not been tested yet!!
      $ cd ..
      $ rm -rf cdsware-0.9.tar.gz cdsware-0.9
      $ mysql -h sqlserver.domain.com -u root -p mysql

2. Detailed instructions for the patient CDS Invenio admin
===================================================

      $ cd /usr/local/src/cdsware-0.9
 
          Change to the directory where you have configured and built
          the CDS Invenio.

      $ gmake uninstall     ## NOTE: This has not been tested yet!!

          This will uninstall all the installed web pages, cgi scripts
          and database utilities from their respective directories.

          Note that it may happen that you will need to clean manually
          HTDOCS directory where all the collection pages were
          created.  We'll test this in the coming future.

          Also, you may want to remove the directories manually in
          case you have added some non-CDS Invenio files to the same place.

      $ cd ..
  
          Go to the parent directory.

      $ rm -rf cdsware-0.9.tar.gz cdsware-0.9

          Wipe out the downloaded tarball and all the CDS Invenio sources.

      $ mysql -h sqlserver.domain.com -u root -p mysql
          mysql> DROP DATABASE cdsware;
          mysql> REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON cdsware.* FROM cdsware@webserver.domain.com;

          Ask your MySQL administrator to execute the above commands
          that will drop the CDS Invenio databases and revoke access rights
          to the CDS Invenio user.

Thanks for testing CDS Invenio.  We would be glad to hear from you
about your CDS Invenio experience.  Please tell us what you think to
help us to improve the system.  Thanks!
