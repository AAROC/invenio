## programs used to convert fulltext files to text:
conv_programs = {#"ps": ["<PSTOTEXT>","<PSTOASCII>"],  # switched off at the moment, since PDF is faster
                 #"ps.gz": ["<PSTOTEXT>","<PSTOASCII>"],
                 "pdf": ["<PDFTOTEXT>","<PSTOTEXT>","<PSTOASCII>"],
                 "doc": ["<ANTIWORD>","<CATDOC>","<WVTEXT>"],
                 "ppt": ["<PPTHTML>"],
                 "xls": ["<XLHTML>"]
                 }
## helper programs used if the above programs convert only to html or other intermediate file formats:
conv_programs_helpers =  {"html": "<HTMLTOTEXT>",
                          "gz": "<GZIP>" }

## safety parameters concerning MySQL thread-multiplication problem:
cfg_check_mysql_threads = 0 # to check or not to check the problem? 
cfg_max_mysql_threads = 50 # how many threads (connections) we consider as still safe
cfg_mysql_thread_timeout = 20 # we'll kill threads that were sleeping for more than X seconds

## do we want to fulltext-index local files only, or also remote URLs?
cfg_fulltext_index_local_files_only = 0

## which language should we use as default?
##{'fr': 'french', 'en': 'english', 'no':'norwegian', 'se':'swedish', 'de': 'german', 'it':'italian', 'pt':'portuguese'}
## None = No stemming
cfg_use_stemmer_lang = None

## path to stopword list, None = no stopword removal
cfg_path_stopwordlist = None

cfg_remove_html_code = True
cfg_min_word_length = 0

## access credentials to access restricted URLs:
## (this may be interesting if you are fulltext-indexing files located
## on a remote server and when files on that server are only available
## via username/password; but it's probably better to handle this case
## via IP or some convention; this part needs more work to be done;
## the current scheme is mostly therein order to make the
## fulltext-indexing mode non-interactive only)
cfg_urlopener_username = "mysuperuser"
cfg_urlopener_password = "mysuperpass"
## FIXME: design a nice approach to fulltext-index (local/remote)
## restricted URLs

## FIXME: put these to the global WML config file one day
