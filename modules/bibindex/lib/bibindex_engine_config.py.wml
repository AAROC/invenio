BibIndex indexing engine configuration parameters.  Mostly read from WML.

## version number:
bibindex_engine_version = "CDSware/<VERSION> bibindex/<VERSION>"

## programs used to convert fulltext files to text:
conv_programs = {#"ps": ["<PSTOTEXT>","<PSTOASCII>"],  # switched off at the moment, since PDF is faster
                 #"ps.gz": ["<PSTOTEXT>","<PSTOASCII>"],
                 "pdf": ["<PDFTOTEXT>","<PSTOTEXT>","<PSTOASCII>"],
                 "doc": ["<ANTIWORD>","<CATDOC>","<WVTEXT>"],
                 "ppt": ["<PPTHTML>"],
                 "xls": ["<XLHTML>"]
                 }
## helper programs used if the above programs convert only to html or other intermediate file formats:
conv_programs_helpers =  {"html": "<HTMLTOTEXT>",
                          "gz": "<GZIP>" }

## safety parameters concerning MySQL thread-multiplication problem:
cfg_check_mysql_threads = 0 # to check or not to check the problem? 
cfg_max_mysql_threads = 50 # how many threads (connections) we consider as still safe
cfg_mysql_thread_timeout = 20 # we'll kill threads that were sleeping for more than X seconds
## FIXME: put these to the global WML config file one day
