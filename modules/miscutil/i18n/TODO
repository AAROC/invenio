* Open issues

** Supported languages

Where should the official list of supported languages come from?
(_not_ the list of _selected_ languages)

 [FG] proposes to have it in the configure.ac script, as it is often
      the case in projects using gettext.


** Post-processing of WML files

Static WML files are processed during the build time, and some strings
are substituted from translations provided in mo files.

As of today, there is no guarantee that the mo files have been
properly generated before the substitution occurs. In addition, there
is no makefile rule that forces the re-build of the static file once
the translation is updated.

This is more an annoyance during development (when files are modified
randomly) than for an end-user performing a clean install, as we can
ensure that miscutil is processed before any other web module.
