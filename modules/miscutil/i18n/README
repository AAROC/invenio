This directory  contains all  the translations of  CDSware in  all the
supported languages.

For  each language  whose 2  letters codename  is <xx>,  a  file named
<xx>.po exists,  and contains a  list of sentences to  translate. This
file   is  in  GNU   Gettext  format.   Please  consult   the  Gettext
documentation for more information.

  <http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/>


* What are all those files?

The directory contains a few scripts (i18n-*.py) and the actual
translation files.

  - <xx>.po files are the master translations. These are the files
    containing the actual work of the translators

  - <xx>.mo are compiled translation files. They are recomputed during
    build time, and installed in the target directory

  - cdsware.pot is the template containing all the requested
    translations, fetched from the source code and the html files.

  - compendium-<xx>.po is a base of known translations, extracted from
    messages.py. It is only necessary during the transition from the
    previous system.


* Adding a new language file

To add support for a new language <xx>, do:

  make update-po-files
  cp cdsware.pot <xx>.po

...and fill in the translations in file <xx>.po.

* Synchronizing the translations with the code

When some sentences have been modified or added in the code, and the
translations must be updated accordingly, do:

  make update-po-files

...and update all the files. To have an idea of the files requiring
modifications, run:

  make check-translations
