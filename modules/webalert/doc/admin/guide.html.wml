     This Admin Guide is not yet completed.  Moreover, some
     admin-level functionality for this module exists only in the form of
     manual recipes.  We are in the process of developing both the
     guide as well as the web admin interface.  If you are interested
     in seeing some specific things implemented with high priority,
     please contact us at <SUPPORTEMAIL>.  Thanks for your interest!

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p><CDSNAME> users may set up an automatic notification email alerts
that would send them documents corresponding to the user profile by
email either daily, weekly, or monthly.  It is the job of the WebAlert
module to permit this functionality.

<h2>Configuring Alert Queries</h2>

<p>Users may set up alert queries for example from their <a
href="<WEBURL>/youralerts.py/display">search history</a> pages.

<p>Administrators may edit existing users' alerts by modifying the
<code>user_query_basket</code> table.  (There is no web interface yet
for this task.)

<h2>Running Alert Engine</h2>

<p>The alert engine has to be run each day in order to send users
email notifications for the alerts they have set up:

   <blockquote>
   <pre>
   $ alertengine
   </pre>
   </blockquote>

<strong>HINT:</strong> You may want to set up an external cron job
to call <code>alertengine</code> each day.
