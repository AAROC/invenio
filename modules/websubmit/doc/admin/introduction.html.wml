        <h3>Things to know before using the Manager:</h3>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
            <UL>
                &nbsp;<span class="guideheader">T</span>his manager tool allows you to administrate all the WebSubmit 
                interface. With it, you will be able to create new actions, new types of documents and edit the existing ones.
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;<span class="guideheader">T</span>he main objects in webSubmit are the "action" (such as 
                "Submit New Record", "Submit New File", "Modify Record"...) and the "type of document" (such as "preprint", 
                "photo"...).<br><br>
                &nbsp;<span class="guideheader">T</span>o one given type of document can be attached several actions.
                An action is the addition of two processes: 
                <UL>
                    <LI>The first one is the <a href="implementwebform.<lang:star: *>.html">data gathering</a>. The manager 
                    will allow you to create new web forms corresponding to the fields the user will have to fill in when using 
                    webSubmit.
                    <LI>The second one is the <a href="implementfunctions.<lang:star: *>.html">data treatement</a>.
                     Basically, what the program will do with the data gathered during the first phase. The treatment appears 
                     in this tool as a sequence of functions. This manager will allow you to add functions to an action, edit the 
                     existing functions, and reorder the functions.
