CERN DOCUMENT SERVER SOFTWARE (CDSware) README
==============================================

Revision: $Id$

CERN Document Server Software (CDSware) is the software developed by,
maintained by, and used at, the CERN Document Server.  It enables you
to run your own electronic preprint server, your own online library
catalogue or a document system on the web.  It complies with the Open
Archive Initiative metadata harvesting protocol and uses MARC-21 as
its underlying bibliographic standard.

At CERN, the CDSware manages over 350 collections of data, consisting of
over 450,000 bibliographic records, including 170,000 fulltext
documents.  (Covering preprints, articles, books, journals,
photographs, and more.  Consult <http://cds.cern.ch/> for details.)

We aim at user friendliness and speed.  Among the features of CDS are:

  - Configurable portal-like interfaces for hosting various kind of
    collections.

  - Powerful search engine with Google-like syntax.

  - User personalization, including document baskets and email
    notification alerts.

The CDS Software is free software licenced under terms of GNU General
Public Licence (GPL).  It is provided on an "as is" basis.  However,
please note that a support contract can be arranged with the CDS
Development Group in which we, the developers, can help you to
install, configure, and maintain the system (featuring email and
telnet support throughout the year), including development of new
local features should a need arise.  If you are interested in
concluding a support contract with us, please contact the CDS
Development Group at <cds.support@cern.ch>.

The CDS software runs on top of MySQL database server and Apache/PHP
web application server.  To install the CDS Software, please consult
the INSTALL file.

Good luck, and thanks for choosing the CERN Document Server Software.
