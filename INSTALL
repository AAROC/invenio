0. Prerequisites
================

   Here is the software you need to have around before you
   start installing CDSware:

     a) Unix-like operating system.  The main development and
        production platform for CDSware at CERN is Debian GNU/Linux,
        but any Unix system supporting the software listed below
        should do.  Note that localhost should have an MTA running
        so that CDSware can email notification alerts or registration
        information to the end users, contact moderators and
        reviewers of submitted documents, inform administrators about
        various runtime system information, etc.

     b) MySQL server (may be on a remote machine), and MySQL client
        (must be available locally too).  MySQL versions 4.0.x are
        recommended, versions above 4.1.0 may cause troubles.
        Please set the variable ``max_allowed_packet'' in your
        ``my.cnf'' init file to at least 4M.
          <http://mysql.com/>

     c) Apache 2 server, with support for loading DSO modules.
        Tested mainly with version 2.0.43 and above.  Apache 2 is
        required for the mod_python module (see below).  
          <http://httpd.apache.org/>

        Note for FreeBSD users: Thierry Thomas <thierry@FreeBSD.org>
        reports troubles with Python open() in the Apache 2 and
        mod_python context.  The solution is either (1) to compile
        Apache 2 with --enable-threads (the port has a knob
        WITH_THREADS to do that); or (2) to add the two following two
        lines in Apache's envvars file:
          LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libc_r.so  # or libpthread.so
          export LD_PRELOAD

     d) Python v2.2.2 or above (v2.3.2 and above recommended): 
         <http://python.org/>
        as well as the following Python modules:
          - (mandatory) MySQLdb:
             <http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python>
          - (mandatory) Numeric module (v21 and above):
             <http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy>
          - (recommended) PyStemmer, for indexing and ranking: 
             <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pystemmer/>
          - (recommended) PyRXP, for very fast XML MARC processing: 
             <http://www.reportlab.org/pyrxp.html>
          - (recommended) Gnuplot.Py, for producing graphs:
             <http://gnuplot-py.sourceforge.net/>
          - (optional) 4suite, slower alternative to PyRXP: 
             <http://4suite.org/>
          - (optional) Psyco, to speed up the code at places:
             <http://psyco.sourceforge.net/>
 
     e) mod_python Apache module.  Tested mainly with versions
        3.0BETA4 and above.  mod_python 3.x is required for Apache 2.
        Previous versions (as well as Apache 1 ones) exhibited some
        problems with MySQL connectivity in our experience.
          <http://www.modpython.org/>

     f) PHP compiled as Apache module, including MySQL support.
        Tested mainly with PHP version 4.3.0 and above.  (Note that if
        you are compiling mod_php from source, it is good to compile
        it against the same MySQL client library as mod_python, so
        that the two Apache modules are using the same MySQL client
        library.  We saw Apache/PHP/Python problems in the past when
        they weren't.)  
          <http://www.php.net/>

     g) PHP compiled as a standalone command-line executable (CLI)
        (in addition to Apache module) is required, too.  As of PHP
        4.3.0 you'll obtain the CLI executable by default, so you
        don't have to compile it separately.  Note that PHP CLI should
        be compiled with the process control support (--enable-pcntl)
        and the compression library (--with-zlib).
          <http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.commandline.php>
          <http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.pcntl.php>

     h) WML - Website META Language.  Tested mainly with versions
        2.0.8 and 2.0.9.  Note that on Red Hat Linux 9 the WML 2.0.9
        compiled with Perl 5.8.0 exhibits problems, so you better use
        downgraded/upgraded Perl for compiling WML on that platform.       
          <http://www.engelschall.com/sw/wml/>

     i) If you want to be able to extract references from PDF fulltext
        files, then you need to install pdftotext version 3 at least.
          <http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/home.html> 

     j) If you want to be able to search for words in the fulltext files 
        (i.e. to have fulltext indexing), then you need as well to install 
        some of the following tools: 
          - for PDF files: pdftotext or pstotext
              <http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/home.html> 
              <http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/doc/AFPL/>
          - for PostScript files: pstotext or ps2ascii
              <http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/doc/AFPL/>
          - for MS Word files: antiword, catdoc, or wvText
              <http://www.winfield.demon.nl/index.html>
              <http://www.ice.ru/~vitus/catdoc/index.html>
              <http://sourceforge.net/projects/wvware>           
          - for MS PowerPoint files: pptHtml and html2text
              <http://www.xlhtml.org/>
              <http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~mbayer/tools/html2text.html>
          - for MS Excel files: xlhtml and html2text
              <http://chicago.sourceforge.net/xlhtml/>
              <http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~mbayer/tools/html2text.html>

     k) If you have chosen to install fast XML MARC Python processors 
        in the step d) above, then you have to install the parsers
        themselves:
          - (optional) RXP: 
             <http://www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/~richard/rxp.html>
          - (optional) 4suite:
             <http://4suite.org/>

     l) (recommended) Gnuplot, the command-line driven interactive
        plotting program.  It is used to display download and citation
        history graphs on the Detailed record pages on the web
        interface.  Note that Gnuplot is not required, only
        recommended.
          <http://www.gnuplot.info/>                      

     m) (recommended) A Common Lisp implementation, such as CLISP,
        SBCL or CMUCL.  It is used for the web server log analysing
        tool and the metadata checking program.  Note that any of the
        three implementations CLISP, SBCL, or CMUCL will do.  CMUCL
        produces fastest machine code, but it does not support UTF-8
        yet.  Pick up CLISP if you don't know what to do.  Note that a
        Common Lisp implementation is not required, only recommended.
          <http://clisp.cons.org/>
          <http://www.cons.org/cmucl/>
          <http://sbcl.sourceforge.net/>     

   Note that the configure script checks whether you have all
   the prerequisite software installed and that it won't let
   you to continue unless everything is in order.  It also warns you 
   if it cannot find some optional, but recommended software.

2. Detailed instructions for the patient CDSware admin
======================================================

   The CERN Document Server Software (CDSware) uses standard GNU autoconf
   method to build and install its files.  This means that you proceed
   as follows:

      $ cd /usr/local/src/
 
          Change to a directory where we will configure and build the
          CDS Software.  (The built files will be installed into
          different "target" directories later.)

      $ wget http://cdsware.cern.ch/download/cdsware-0.3.2.tar.gz
      $ wget http://cdsware.cern.ch/download/cdsware-0.3.2.tar.gz.md5
      $ wget http://cdsware.cern.ch/download/cdsware-0.3.2.tar.gz.sig

          Fetch CDSware source tarball from the CDSware distribution
          server, together with MD5 checksum and GnuPG cryptographic
          signature files useful for verifying the integrity of the
          tarball.

      $ md5sum -v -c cdsware-0.3.2.tar.gz.md5

          Verify MD5 checksum.

      $ gpg --verify cdsware-0.3.2.tar.gz.sig cdsware-0.3.2.tar.gz

          Verify GnuPG cryptographic signature.  Note that you may
          first have to import my public key into your keyring, if you
          haven't done that already:
            $ gpg --keyserver wwwkeys.pgp.net --recv-keys 0xBA5A2B67
          The output of the gpg --verify command should then read:
            Good signature from "Tibor Simko <tibor@simko.info>"
          You can safely ignore any trusted signature certification
          warning that may follow after the signature has been
          successfully verified.

      $ tar xvfz cdsware-0.3.2.tar.gz

          Untar the distribution tarball.    

      $ cd cdsware-0.3.2
   
          Go to the source directory.

      $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/cdsware-DEMO \
                    --with-webdir=/var/www/DEMO \
                    --with-weburl=http://webserver.domain.com/DEMO \
                    --with-dbhost=sqlserver.domain.com \
                    --with-dbname=cdsware \
                    --with-dbuser=cdsware \
                    --with-dbpass=myp1ss \
                    --with-python=/opt/python/bin/python2.3

          Configure essential CDSware parameters, with the following
          signification:

             --prefix=/usr/local/cdsware-DEMO 

                 The CDSware general installation directory, used to
                 hold command-line binaries and program libraries
                 containing the core CDSware functionality, but also
                 to store runtime log and cache information.  Several
                 subdirs like `bin', `lib', and `var' will be created
                 inside the --prefix directory to this effect.  Note
                 that the --prefix directory should be chosen outside
                 of the Apache htdocs tree, since no file from this
                 directory is to be accessible on the Web.

             --with-webdir=/var/www/DEMO

                 The directory holding the web interface to CDSware,
                 i.e. containing all the callable scripts and web
                 pages visible to the end user.  Must be located
                 inside Apache htdocs tree.  The scripts within this
                 directory will generally call core CDSware libraries
                 and binaries installed in the --prefix directory.

             --with-weburl=http://webserver.domain.com/DEMO

                 The URL corresponding to the --with-webdir directory.
                 It will denote the home URL of your CDSware
                 installation.

             --with-dbhost=sqlserver.domain.com
             --with-dbname=cdsware
             --with-dbuser=cdsware
             --with-dbpass=myp1ss 

                 The database server host, the database name, and the
                 database user credentials.

              --with-python=/opt/python/bin/python2.3

                 Optionally, specify a path to some specific Python
                 binary.  This is useful if you have more than one
                 Python installation on your system.  If you don't set
                 this option, then the first Python that will be found
                 in your PATH will be chosen for running CDSware.

          CDSware won't install to any other directory but to the two
          mentioned in this configuration line.  Do not use trailing
          slashes when specifying any of the above values.

          This configuration step is mandatory, and is referred to as
          "pre-compile time configuration step a)" in the elucidative
          explanatory commentary below.  

          (Note that if you prefer to build CDSware out of its source
           tree, you may run the above configure command like this: 
           $ mkdir build && cd build && ../configure --prefix=...)

      $ vi ./config/config.wml  ## optional, but strongly recommended

          Optionally, customize your CDSware installation.  We
          strongly recommend you to edit at least the top of this file
          where you can define some very essential CDSware parameters
          like the name of your CDSware document server or the email
          address of the local CDSware administrator.  (The latter is
          needed if you want to use administration modules, and you
          certainly do!)

          The rest of the "config.wml" file enables you to change the
          CDSware web page look and feel, and otherwise to influence
          its behaviour and default parameters.

          This configuration step is optional, but strongly
          recommended.  It is referred to as "compile time
          configuration step b)" in the elucidative explanatory
          commentary below.

      $ make

          Launch the CDSware build.  Since many messages are printed
          during the build process, you may want to run it in a
          fast-scrolling terminal such as rxvt or in a detached screen
          session.

          During this step all the pages and scripts will be
          pre-created and customized based on the config you have
          edited in the previous step.

          Before proceeding further with the CDSware installation, we
          have to do some admin-level tasks on the MySQL and Apache
          servers.

      $ mysql -h sqlserver.domain.com -u root -p mysql
          mysql> CREATE DATABASE cdsware;
          mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON cdsware.* TO cdsware@webserver.domain.com IDENTIFIED BY 'myp1ss';
        
          You need to create a dedicated database on your MySQL server
          that the CDSware can use for its purposes.  Please
          contact your MySQL administrator and ask him to execute the
          above commands that will create the "cdsware" database, a
          user called "cdsware" with password "myp1ss", and that will
          grant all rights on the "cdsware" database to the "cdsware"
          user.

          (Of course, you are free to choose your own user credentials
           and the database name; the above values were just an
           example.  See also the configure line below.)

      $ sudo vi /path/to/apache/conf/httpd.conf ## see below in part 2

          Please ask your webserver administrator to put the following
          lines in your "httpd.conf" configuration file:

              AddDefaultCharset UTF-8
              AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
              AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps
              DirectoryIndex index.en.html index.html index.py index.en.php index.php 

          This is to ensure that the browsers will get UTF-8 as
          the default page encoding, that "*.php" files will be
          interpreted by the web server as PHP files, and that
          "index.py" or "index.en.php" will be considered as directory
          index file.

          In addition, you have to ask Apache to interpret .py files
          in the installation place via mod_python and to indicate
          path to CDSware's Python library directory (composed from
          your --prefix choice followed by `/lib/python'):

              <Directory /var/www/DEMO/>
                 AddHandler python-program .py
                 PythonHandler mod_python.publisher
                 PythonPath "['/usr/local/cdsware-DEMO/lib/python']+sys.path" 
                 PythonDebug On
              </Directory>
            
      $ sudo vi /path/to/php/conf/php.ini ## see below in part 2

          Please ask your webserver administrator to put the following
          lines in your "php.ini" configuration file:
          
              log_errors = on
              display_errors = off
              expose_php = off
              max_execution_time = 160
	      register_globals = on
	      short_open_tag = on

          This will set up some relevant PHP variables.
           
      $ sudo /path/to/apache/bin/apachectl graceful

          Please ask your webserver administrator to restart the
          Apache server after the above "httpd.conf" and "php.ini"
          changes.

          After these admin-level tasks to be performed as root, let's
          now go back to finish the installation of the CDSware package.

      $ make create-tables     ## optional

          Optionally, create CDSware tables on the MySQL server.  You
          probably want to do this step only once, i.e. if you have
          not created any CDSware database and tables yet.

      $ make install

          Install the web pages, scripts, utilities and everything
          needed for runtime into the respective directories, as
          specified earlier by the configure command.

          After this step, you should be able to point your browser to
          the chosen URL of your local CDSware installation and see it
          running!

      $ make test

          Optionally, you can run our test suite to verify the results
          of known tests on your local CDSware installation.  Note
          that this command should be run only after you have
          installed the whole system via `make install'.

      $ sudo chown -R www-data /usr/local/cdsware-DEMO/var

          One more superuser step, as we need to enable Apache server
          to write some log information and to cache interesting
          entities inside the "var" subdirectory of our CDSware
          general installation directory.

          Here we assume that your Apache server processes are run
          under "www-data" group.  Change this appropriately for your
          system.

      $ make create-demo-site  ## optional

          This step is recommended to test your local CDSware
          installation.  It should give you our "Atlantis Institute of
          Science" demo installation, exactly as you see it at
          <http://cdsware.cern.ch/DEMO/>.

      $ make load-demo-records  ## optional

          Optionally, load some demo records to be able to test
          indexing and searching of your local demo CDSware
          installation.

      $ make remove-demo-records ## optional

          Optionally, remove the demo records loaded in the previous
          step but otherwise keep the demo collection, submit, format
          etc configurations that you may reuse and modify for
          production purposes.

      $ make drop-demo-site ## optional

          Optionally, drop also all the demo configuration so that
          you'll have a blank CDSware system for your production
          purposes.

      $ netscape http://webserver.domain.com/DEMO/admin/ ## optional

          Optionally, do further runtime configuration of the CDSware,
          like definition of data collections, document types,
          document formats, word file tables, etc.

          This configuration step is optional, and is referred to as
          "runtime configuration step c)" in the elucidative
          explanatory commentary below.  
   
3. Configuration philosophy explained and elucidated
====================================================

   As you could see from the above, the configuration of the CDSware is
   threefold: 

      (a) pre-compile time configuration phase 
          [uses command line options / while doing "configure"]
      (b) compile time configuration phase 
          [uses WML / after "configure", while doing "make && make install"]
      (c) runtime configuration phase 
          [uses MySQL / after "make install", while doing "netscape http://webserver.domain.com/DEMO/admin/"]

   What is the difference, and why?

      (a) pre-compile time configuration phase 
          [uses command line options / while doing "configure"]

          This configures essential CDSware parameters that makes your
          CDSware copy installable and runable.  The essential parameters
          include: general CDSware installation directory containing
          (among others) binaries, libraries, and log and cache
          directories; install directory for Web scripts and pages;
          and MySQL user and server credentials.

          This configuration step uses standard GNU autoconf approach,
          i.e. you will run the standard "configure" script.  Note
          that the only arguments that CDSware takes into consideration
          are the general "--prefix" one and CDSware-specific
          "--with-foo" arguments, see the end of "configure --help"
          output.

          This configuration step is mandatory.  Without knowing
          theses essential parameters there is nothing to install and
          nothing to run.  

          Usually, you do this step only once.

      (b) compile time configuration phase 
          [uses WML / after "configure", while doing "make && make install"]

          Optionally, you may choose to influence CDSware behaviour, to
          set up CDSware system name, to choose its default parameters,
          to change its look and feel, to add your local web pages, etc.  

          This configuration step uses WML, the Website META Language.
          The most important configuration file is "config/config.wml"
          that you can edit at your will.  Optionally, if you are an
          advanced user, you may edit other WML files in the
          distribution tree.

          After that, when you type "make", the CDSware pages will be
          pre-generated.  We prefer that this configuration step is
          done during compile-time and not runtime, because of
          multiple reasons: (i) the pre-generated pages impose less
          load on the web server and the database server and so they
          are served faster to the end user; (ii) we use several
          different languages (Python, PHP) and by using independent
          compile-time configuration language we can share the same
          configuration variables across heterogeneous languages;
          (iii) use of WML and page templates enables you to easily
          change anything in the CDSware system, even into deep
          levels.

          If you are changing parameters and/or look and feel
          of CDSware pages, you may want to repeat these step several
          times:

              $ vi config/config.wml
              $ make drop-tables
              $ make create-tables
              $ make create-demo-site
              $ make load-demo-records
              $ netscape http://webserver.domain.com/DEMO/
              [...]

          to see what it brings, until you are satisfied with the
          result.

          (Note that you may as well choose to change these parameters
          inside the CDSware library configuration files later on,
          during runtime, at least for non-static Python and PHP
          pages.)

      (c) runtime configuration phase 
          [uses MySQL / after "make install", while doing "netscape http://webserver.domain.com/DEMO/admin/"]

          Optionally, you will most probably want to define specific
          data collections, to configure submit and search page for those
          collections, to specify search options and word files to
          search in, formats how to display data, etc.  

          This configuration step uses MySQL configuration tables and
          is done during the runtime, for your convenience.  It means
          that after previous configuration step (b), and after
          successful "make install", if you are happy with its result
          you no longer edit WML files within the CDSware source tree but
          rather configure "fully running" CDSware installation via
          its Administration web interface.
         
          Usually, you will do this step many times in the future, to
          tweak the running installation, to add new collections and
          data types, etc.

          (Note that if you want to change something "deeper" in a
          running CDSware installation, such as look and feel of pages,
          or to add some new pages, then you may want to edit library
          configuration files for Python and PHP non-static pages, as
          noted above.  But if you want to do really "deep" changes,
          you need to go back to WML source, so you may want to leave
          your customized copy of the CDSware WML source tree around.)

   We hope that this explains why we have chosen this three-level
   configuration model, and that you will find it convenient in real
   life.

Good luck, and thanks for choosing the CERN Document Server Software.
