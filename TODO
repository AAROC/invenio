CDSware TODO list
=================

Suitable for editing with Emacs ToDoo mode, see
<http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/ToDoo>.

* the Personalization part is not I18N-ized yet, and there are not
  very many personalization options.  We plan to expand it at some
  point in the future, like a possibility to select default
  language, default number of hits per page, default sorting, etc.

* bibsched task sleeping sometimes cannot be done directly
  Sometimes when you try to make bibsched task sleeping, you cannot do
  it because MySQL is active for the task elsewhere:
   _mysql_exceptions.ProgrammingError: (2014, "Commands out of
   sync;You can't run this command now")

o [simko] language-dependent collection names
  Received Mon Mar  8 19:22:46 2004

Upon first look I don't see any problem with your setup.  Apart from
an eventual end-user problem of seeing a collection named ``EPFL
Library Catalogue'' on the search results page, but when she clicks on
this collection name the name changes to ``Swiss Federal Institute of
Technology Lausanne'', which may be confusing.  To avoid this problem,
we usually call CDSNAME the same way as the collection #1 and the same
way as the default language of the interface.

Anyhow, this touches clearly a more general problem with translations
of collection names.  CDSware v0.3.0 now contains a possibility to
name the same collection in many different languages in a clean way.
I'll prepare a demo for v0.3.1.  This possibility will solve the above
mentioned end-user confusion-prone display in a clean way.

I think so.  WebSearch caches certain things and it may not update the
information on which records belong to which collections.  The caching
issue is being rethought in the current WebSearch, maybe I'll add a
forcing option for date/time lookup or something.  I've added a note
in my TODO file to do more investigations.  In any case, you may run
`apachectl graceful' each hour in a cron job.

o [tibor] Internal Error exceptions.KeyError 'Articles & Preprints' 
  ``Fixed'' by restarting Apache.  It appears that you contacted a
  server process exactly when it was being restarted, as the cache is
  usually filled upon Apache startup.  I'll have a closer look and fix
  it properly later.
  Seems to be connected to the runaway client number problem.
  Maybe run_sql() should be revised.
  Received Tue Jan 20 10:56:02 2004
  
  Possibly done by improving run_sql() for v0.3.0 and by fixing search
  cache thingie for v0.3.2

  They are now shown only in the language of the installation.
  And I18N creation is now faster, so I'll keep creating them all.
