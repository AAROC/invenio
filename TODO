o [tibor] in search for ``title: goo'' the space should be ignored

o [tibor] Internal Error exceptions.KeyError 'Articles & Preprints' 
  ``Fixed'' by restarting Apache.  It appears that you contacted a
  server process exactly when it was being restarted, as the cache is
  usually filled upon Apache startup.  I'll have a closer look and fix
  it properly later.
  Seems to be connected to the runaway client number problem.
  Maybe run_sql() should be revised.
